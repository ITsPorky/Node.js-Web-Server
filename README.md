# Node.js-Web-Server
A simple Node.js and Express.js web server to host static files.

Setup Notes:
1. You must have node installed for this web server to work
2. Then run the setup.bat file to install all node packages that the web server uses.
3. Once the node mosules are installed, you can start the server using the run_server.bat file.
4. If you wish to open a tunnel to your local host I used ngrok. If you wish to do this you will have to 
install ngrok and edit the run_server.bat file to the loaction of the ngrok.exe file.
5. If you don't wish to open your local host you can edit the run_server.bat and comment out the ngrok lines.
